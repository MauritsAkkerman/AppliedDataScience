    "This notebook makes use of (a subset of) a public dataset of the Google Merchandise store. This is real-life data from Google Analytics and looks like something you might get from a company when asked to perform data science experiments using their webstore data. Note that therefore the examples might not always look as perfect as you might find in other online materials, but this is real-life data science, and you never get perfect data to start with.\n",

To run the Python code, you need to press the play button in the top left corner of the grey box. Again, sometimes you are requested to perform a simple action in order to run the Python code.

    "We can draw more conclusions from these results, namely that the intercept is very high for webstore sales. The intercept of 2.38 means that even with zero pageviews a customer would spend $2.38 dollars. Since a webstore is known to have very low conversion percentages, in the range of 1%-5%, this high intercept is an unlikely result. The high intercept could be explained by several factors. First, outliers are still affecting the results of the linear regression. Second, the conversion rate of the customers in the dataset is much higher than the industry standard.\n",
